# Switchpack

The Tesla seat switchpack is the collection of controls on the side of the seat. There are three physical controls, connected via a four-wire harness.

Electrically, the switchpack interface has three signal wires and one ground line. When actuated, the switches assigned to each line vary the resistance of their corresponding wire.
