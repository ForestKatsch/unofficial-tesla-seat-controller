| [3-pin 2.54mm male header](https://a.co/d/1hqvut4)           | 2x       |
| [4-pin 2.54mm male header ](https://a.co/d/1hqvut4)          | 1x       |
| [XT30 horizontal male through-hole](https://a.co/d/ecAGn9J)  | 1x       |
| [2-pin 5mm screw terminal connector](https://a.co/d/eVUlu4d) | 1x       |
| 0805 100nF capacitor                                         | 3x       |
| 0805 1k resistor                                             | 3x       |

You'll also need the four primary Arduino headers (no need for the two 2x3 pin headers). I recommend using [male pin headers](https://a.co/d/1hqvut4) mounted beneath the board to avoid physical contact with components on the motor driver shield.
